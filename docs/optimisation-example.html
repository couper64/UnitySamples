            <p>This project was done as a team using Unity 2018.2.6f1. Particularly, Unity Profiler was used to optimise the perfonmance.</p>
            <p>The IDE of choice was Visual Studio 2017. The project required some scripting fixes.</p>
            <p>
                The game was done during the Game Jam at Kingston University. The team consisted of 5 people: Michael Parollini, Alessio, Dario, 
                Thanaphon Sanongkhun and me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main bottleneck of the project was memory management. Due to constant allocate of the data 
                the system started to lag and caused the game to freeze.
            </p>
            <p>
                This issue was fixed by pre-allocating required data and re-using it later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another in-efficiency I found were shadows. They were not required for the project and caused additional overhead therefore 
                shadows were removed from the project in Quality settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the graphics settings were moved from high quality to low quality because the difference was unnoticeable. Profiler did not 
                show any abnormalities in other parts of the game like Scripting, Physics or Networking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over all, the perfomance increased significantly. For instance, number of batches dropped from 5 million 
                to 100 at the most loaded moment. The main gameplay process showed about 30-60 batches.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, for the demo of this scale the perfomance results are satisfying.
